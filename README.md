$ lets-code
[lets-code] thinking support: true (startup level: high)
[lets-code] image input: true
[lets-code] connecting: http://localhost:8000  model: Qwen/Qwen3-32B  context: 131072  output cap: 32768  git guard: pi/20261008-2144
```

## Why

You have a GPU box serving a model with vLLM, SGLang or Ollama. You want a
real coding agent on it, not a chat window. pi is that agent, but it has to
be told about your server: the URL, the model id, the true context window,
whether the model thinks, whether it sees images. Get one of those wrong and
you get a silent overflow at hour two, or screenshots that never reach the
model.

lets-code figures all of that out from the server itself, every time you
launch, and adds the guard rails a small local model needs.

## Quick start

```bash
npx @civitas-cerebrum/lets-code setup   # endpoints, token, optional CA; installs pi if missing
lets-code                               # go
```

Setup installs the `lets-code` command itself. No npm? Grab the script:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/civitas-cerebrum/lets-code/main/lets-code -o ~/.local/bin/lets-code
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/lets-code && lets-code setup
```

Needs `bash` 3.2+, `curl`, `python3`. `node`/`npm` only if it installs pi for you.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔎 **Discovery** | First reachable endpoint wins. Model id and context window come from `/v1/models`. |
| 🧠 **Thinking probe** | One tiny request with thinking forced on. Reasoning tokens in the reply mean pi gets a thinking model, with per-level budgets vLLM enforces. |
| 👁 **Vision probe** | One tiny request with a red 64×64 image. "Red" in the reply means pi may send screenshots. Setup asks you if the probe can't tell. |
| 📏 **Overflow-proof** | The output cap is reserved in pi's compaction settings, so `input + max_tokens` can never exceed the server window. |
| 🧯 **Memory guard** | When the box runs low on RAM, the session's own runaway process is stopped. Nothing else on the machine is touched. |
| 🛟 **Git guard** | All work on a `pi/*` branch. `reset --hard`, force pushes and friends are refused. The tree is checkpointed before every tool call. |
| 🔒 **No secrets on disk** | The token lives in a mode-600 config and reaches pi through the environment. pi's telemetry is off unless you turn it on. |

Everything is re-derived at launch, so swapping models on the server needs
no edits here.

## Daily use

```bash
lets-code                         # interactive session
lets-code -p "fix the failing test"   # one-shot; unknown args go to pi
lets-code --model other-id        # pin something for one launch
lets-code --thinking-level low    # quieter model
lets-code --no-git-guard          # you know what you're doing
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--url <base>` | Endpoint for this launch (scheme and `/v1` optional) |
| `--model <id>` | Model for this launch (default: discovered) |
| `--context <tok>` | Context window (default: discovered, else 128000) |
| `--output-cap <tok>` | Max output tokens (default 32768) |
| `--api <dialect>` | `openai-completions` (default), `openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages`, `google-generative-ai` |
| `--thinking-level <lvl>` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` (default `medium`) |
| `--vision` / `--no-vision` | Pin image input instead of probing |
| `--insecure` | Skip TLS verification |
| `--no-mem-guard` / `--no-git-guard` | Launch without a guard |
| `--verbose` | Show each endpoint probe |

<details>
<summary><b>Config file and environment</b></summary>

`~/.config/lets-code/config` is shell syntax, mode 600, written by setup.
Every key has an environment override, `LETS_CODE_<KEY>`, which wins.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ENDPOINTS` | Space-separated base URLs, most preferred first. IPs, `localhost`, bare hostnames and `*.local` get `http://`, other domains `https://`. |
| `TOKEN` | API key. Any value works for a server without auth. |
| `CA_PATH` | Root CA for an https endpoint with a private CA (exported as `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`). |
| `MODEL`, `CONTEXT`, `OUTPUT_CAP`, `API` | Pins; empty means discovered or default. |
| `VISION`, `REASONING` | `true`/`false` pins; empty means probed at launch. |
| `THINKING` | Startup thinking level. Setup suggests one from the context window. |
| `MEM_GUARD`, `GIT_GUARD` | `false` turns a guard off. |

Listing several endpoints lets one config follow you around:
`http://localhost:8000 https://llm.home.example` works on the server box,
on the LAN and over a VPN.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Server setup (vLLM, nginx, private TLS)</b></summary>

vLLM needs tool calling and, for thinking models, a reasoning parser:

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-32B --max-model-len 131072 \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes --reasoning-parser qwen3
```

Behind nginx, set `proxy_buffering off` so tokens stream. For a private CA
(mkcert, step-ca), give setup the public root certificate. The winning
https endpoint must be trusted, or launched with `--insecure`.

With a reasoning parser, vLLM also enforces the per-level thinking budget
pi sends (`thinking_token_budget`), so a model cannot think its way through
the whole output cap.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Memory guard (Linux)</b></summary>

A test with an unbounded search can take all RAM and freeze the machine
that serves the model. The guard watches free RAM and only ever acts on
processes this session started:

| Free RAM | Action |
|---|---|
| under 20 % | pi is warned, with the session's largest processes listed |
| under 10 % | new bash commands are blocked, except cleanup (`kill`, `ps`, `free`) |
| under 5 % for 3 s | the largest process is stopped: SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL, 10 s apart |
| under 2.5 % | the largest process is killed at once |

Nothing is capped; pi is told what was stopped and why. The guard is a pi
extension (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/lets-code-memguard.ts`) and is inert in
sessions not started by lets-code. It defers to a machine-wide
[memguard](https://github.com/civitas-cerebrum/memguard) daemon when one runs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Git guard</b></summary>

Small models make the mistakes a reviewer would catch: a wrong
`reset --hard`, an edit that guts a file, a stray `rm`. So:

- **Work happens on a `pi/*` branch.** At launch, a repo that is not on one
  gets `pi/<timestamp>`; uncommitted changes come along. In the session, a
  hook reads `.git/HEAD` before each edit, write and bash call. On any
  other branch only inspection, `--continue`/`--abort` and a switch back
  to a `pi/*` branch are allowed.
- **Irreversible commands are refused on every branch:** force pushes,
  `branch -D`, `reset --hard`, `checkout <path>`, `clean -f`, `stash drop`,
  writes into `.git`, `rm` of the repo or `.git`, and their aliases and
  abbreviations. The hook parses bash like a shell (quotes, `&&`, `$(…)`,
  heredocs, `sh -c`, `cd`, `git -C`), so it cannot be tricked by spelling.
- **Checkpoints.** Before and after each tool call the working tree is
  snapshotted under `refs/pi-checkpoints/<branch>/<stamp>` through a
  private index. HEAD, index and branches are untouched; nothing is pushed.

```bash
git for-each-ref refs/pi-checkpoints/                            # list
git diff refs/pi-checkpoints/pi/x/20261005-231502.117            # what changed since
git restore --source=refs/pi-checkpoints/pi/x/20261005-231502.117 -- src/a.c
```

The guard costs no tokens: the model only sees a one-line reason when a
call is blocked. Merging the `pi/*` branch back is yours. Outside a git
repo the guard is off. `LETS_CODE_GIT_CHECKPOINTS=0` turns checkpoints off.

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshooting</b></summary>

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `no endpoint reachable` | Server down, wrong URL, or DNS. `lets-code --verbose` shows each probe. |
| `certificate this machine doesn't trust` | Set `CA_PATH`, or `--insecure` to test. |
| Output arrives all at once | A proxy is buffering. nginx: `proxy_buffering off`. |
| Tool-call errors in server logs | Start the server with `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser <p>`. |
| Thinking text in the output | Missing `--reasoning-parser`. |
| Session dies on long tasks | Wrong context size. Check `context:` on the launch line; pin `CONTEXT=` if the server hides `max_model_len`. |
| Model does not see images, or does not think | Check the `image input:` / `thinking support:` launch lines. Pin `VISION=true` / `REASONING=true` if a probe was inconclusive. |
| pi says provider `lets-code` is unknown | Re-run `lets-code`; it re-registers on every launch. |

</details>

## Under the hood

Each launch probes the endpoints, reads `/v1/models`, runs the thinking and
vision probes, then writes pi's `models.json` and `settings.json` under the
provider id `lets-code`. Your other providers and settings are untouched.
pi's file-search helpers (`fd`, `ripgrep`) are fetched before the first
start so the first session starts clean. Design notes and the reasoning
behind each decision are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

`tests/run.sh` runs the suite CI runs on every pull request: shell tests
for the probes and endpoint parsing, node tests for the git guard and
checkpoints. `tests/mem-guard-live.sh` is a tmux-driven end-to-end run for
the memory guard. Releases are published to npm from GitHub releases.
